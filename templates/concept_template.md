<!------------ Formatting ------------------------->

<!-- Some examples of how to mark up various things

This is _italics_ and this is **bold**.

Only use italics and bold for specific things. 

This is `inline code`. Use it for referencing package names and commands.

Here's a command someone types on a command line:

```command
which go
```

Here's output from a command:

```
/usr/local/go/bin/go
```

Write key presses in ALLCAPS with in-line code formatting: `ENTER`.

Use a plus symbol (+) if keys need to be pressed simultaneously: `CTRL+C`.

<$>[note]
**Note:** This is a note.
<$>

<$>[warning]
**Warning:** This is a warning.
<$>

See [Notes, cautions, warnings, and other notices](https://developers.google.com/style/notices).

Add screenshots in PNG format with a self-describing filename. Embed them in the article using the following format:
