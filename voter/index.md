# Polling app

This tutorial creates a simple blockchain poll application.

![Application screenshot](./1.png)

This tutorial builds understanding as it walks you through creating a blockchain app, adding and modifying types for a transaction, editing messages, and designing the front end app.

**You will learn how to**

- Create a simple blockchain poll application
- Design a front-end app that lets a user sign in, create polls, cast votes, and see voting results
- Add logic to require funds to execute the transaction
- Modify a REST endpoint
- Modify CLI transactions
- Add module components to the frontend app
- Add a bank keeper to the module
- Modify a message

## Requirements

This tutorial requires [Starport](https://docs.starport.network/) v0.15.1\. The tutorial is based on this specific version of Starport.

The Starport tool is the easiest way to build a blockchain and accelerates chain development.

To install `starport` into `/usr/local/bin`, run the following command:

```
curl https://get.starport.network/starport@v0.15.1! | bash
```

When the installation succeeds, you see this message:

```
Installed at /usr/local/bin/starport
```

You can use Starport in a [browser-based IDE](http://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tendermint/starport/tree/v0.15.1), but this tutorial assumes you are using a local Starport installation. See [Install Starport](https://docs.starport.network/intro/install.html).

## Voting App Goals

Create a blockchain poll app with a voting module. The app requires that the end user can:

- Sign in
- Create polls
- Cast votes
- See voting results

Design the app so that you can:

- Collect transaction fees:

  - The create poll transaction fee is 200 tokens.
  - Voting is free.

- Restrict transactions only to signed in users.

## Build your Blockchain App

Use Starport to scaffold the blockchain app and the voting module.

### Build the new blockchain

To scaffold a new blockchain named voter:

```
starport app github.com/username/voter
```

A new directory named `voter` is created in your home directory.

The `voter` directory contains a working blockchain app and all of the code you need to build and launch a blockchain-based app, including these files and directories:

- `app` contains files that connect all of the moving parts of your application
- `cmd` is responsible for the `voterd` daemon that starts and interacts with the app
- `proto` contains the protobuf types
- `vue` contains the web user interface as shown at the top of this tutorial
- `x` contains the Cosmos SDK `voter` module

Cosmos SDK modules are the building blocks of apps. If you are new to Cosmos SDK modules, see [Introduction to SDK Modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/building-modules/intro.html).

### Launch the voter app

To launch the app from the `voter` project directory:

```
cd voter
starport serve
```

The following output is returned, along with any errors that might show up in your application. Two default users and their mnemonic pass phrases are created.

```
Cosmos SDK's version is: Stargate v0.40.0 (or above)

üöÄ Get started: http://localhost:12345
```

**Congratulations!** You successfully created and launched a blockchain application.

## Add a Poll Transaction

The voter app doesn't do anything yet, so the next step is to add some types. Adding types generates files that implement create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality for a custom new type.

The voting applications has two types of entities: polls and votes.

### Add the poll type

A poll type has a `title` and a list of `options`.

In a new terminal window, run the following command in the `voter` directory:

```
starport type poll title options
```

After the poll type is successfully created, you see:

```
üéâ Created a type `poll`
```

With this command, you generated the code that handles the creation of `poll` items.

### View the front-end user interface

To see the app front-end form for creating polls:

- Run `starport serve`
- Visit <http://localhost:8080>

It takes a few minutes to rebuild the app, so give it a couple of seconds. If your `localhost:8080` is already in use, your app can be viewed on the next available port.

![Application screenshot](./2.png)

### Sign in as Alice

On the app frontend, sign in as Alice. The mnemonic passphrases for Alice and Bob were printed in the console after you ran the `starport serve` command.

After you are signed in as Alice, you can import an existing wallet that was created with the app. The wallet in the voter app can handle multiple accounts, so give your wallet a descriptive name. Using a descriptive wallet name helps you recognize this wallet in future transactions. For this example, naming this wallet `voter` makes sense.

1. Click **Access Wallet** and then click **Import existing wallet**.
2. Enter the passphrase for Alice that was output to your console when you launched the voter app with the `starport serve` command.
3. Name your wallet `voter` and enter a password.
4. Click **Done**.

Now you want to view the custom `poll` type you created earlier.

## View the Poll Type

To view the newly created `poll` transaction type, click the **Custom Type** navigation point on the web browser frontend app.

To see the workflow to create a poll, enter an example value for the title and poll options. A new object is created and displayed next to the new poll form. You have successfully created an object and stored it on the blockchain!

This object, however, does not look and work exactly like a poll. You need to be able to add option fields and store them as an array. You want the option fields to display as interactive buttons.

Take a look at some of the files modified by the `starport type` command.

## Modify the Protobuffer Types

To have multiple options in the poll, you must change the value `string options` in the Protobuffer definitions.

1. In the `proto/voter` directory, open the `poll.proto` file.
2. To allow passing an array of strings, add the keyword `repeated` before `string options`:

  ```proto
  message Poll {
  string creator = 1;
  uint64 id = 2;
  string title = 3;
  repeated string options = 4;
  }
  ```

In the `proto/voter/tx.proto` file, update the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) types for the poll transaction.

1. Add the keyword `repeated` before `string options` for the `MsgCreatePoll` message:

```proto
   message MsgCreatePoll {
   string creator = 1;
   string title = 2;
   repeated string options = 3;
   }
```

And the `MsgUpdatePoll` message:

```proto
  message MsgUpdatePoll {
  string creator = 1;
  uint64 id = 2;
  string title = 3;
  repeated string options = 4;
  }
```

## Modify the Poll Transaction Message

Navigate to the file at `x/voter/types/message_poll.go` that defines a message that creates a poll.

1. To store the options as a list instead of a string, replace `options string` with `options []string` in the `NewMsgCreatePoll` function:

```go
// x/voter/types/message_poll.go
func NewMsgCreatePoll(creator string, title string, options []string) *MsgCreatePoll {
    return &MsgCreatePoll{
        Creator: creator,
        Title:   title,
        Options: options,
    }
}
```

And also in the `NewMsgUpdatePoll` function:

```go
// x/voter/types/message_poll.go
func NewMsgUpdatePoll(creator string, id uint64, title string, options []string) *MsgUpdatePoll {
    return &MsgUpdatePoll{
        Id:      id,
        Creator: creator,
        Title:   title,
        Options: options,
    }
}
```

## About the Poll Keeper

To write anything to a blockchain or perform any other state transition a client, in our case the voter web app, makes an HTTP POST request. The POST request with a title and options goes to the <http://localhost:1317/voter/poll> endpoint handler that is defined in `x/voter/client/rest/txPoll.go`.

The handler creates an unsigned transaction that contains an array of messages. The client then signs the transaction and sends it to <http://localhost:1317/txs>. The application processes the transaction by sending each message to a corresponding handler, in our case `x/voter/handler.go`.

A handler then calls a `CreatePoll` function that is defined in `x/voter/keeper/poll.go` that writes the poll data into the store.

### Modify the Poll Keeper

The keeper adds the polls to the blockchain database.

Navigate to the file at `x/voter/keeper/poll.go`. You need to make the same changes to modify the poll keeper to use the list of options.

- Change the `options` parameter from `string` to `[]string` in the `AppendPoll` function:

```go
// x/voter/keeper/poll.go
func (k Keeper) AppendPoll(
    ctx sdk.Context,
    creator string,
    title string,
    options []string,
) uint64 {
    // Create the poll
    count := k.GetPollCount(ctx)
    var poll = types.Poll{
        Creator: creator,
        Id:      count,
        Title:   title,
        Options: options,
    }

    store := prefix.NewStore(ctx.KVStore(k.storeKey), types.KeyPrefix(types.PollKey))
    value := k.cdc.MustMarshalBinaryBare(&poll)
    store.Set(GetPollIDBytes(poll.Id), value)

    // Update poll count
    k.SetPollCount(ctx, count+1)

    return count
}
```

## Modify the REST Endpoint

The REST endpoint is defined in the file `x/voter/client/rest/txPoll.go`.

Replace `Options string` with `Options []string` in `createPollRequest` struct.

```go
type createPollRequest struct {
    BaseReq rest.BaseReq `json:"base_req"`
    Creator string       `json:"creator"`
    Title   string       `json:"title"`
    Options []string     `json:"options"`
}
```

And also in the `updatePollRequest` struct.

```go
type updatePollRequest struct {
    BaseReq rest.BaseReq `json:"base_req"`
    Creator string       `json:"creator"`
    Title   string       `json:"title"`
    Options []string     `json:"options"`
}
```

### Modify the CLI Transaction

A poll app user can also interact with your application by using a command line interface.

The CLI definition is available at `x/voter/client/cli/txPoll.go`.

For example:

```
votercli tx voter create-poll "Text editors" "Emacs" "Vim" --from alice
```

This command generates a transaction with "create poll" message, sign it using a private key of `alice` (one of two users created by default), and broadcast the transaction to the blockchain.

The modification you need to make is to change a line that reads arguments from the console.

In the function `CmdCreatePoll` replace:

```go
Args:  cobra.ExactArgs(2),
```

with

```go
Args:  cobra.MinimumNArgs(2),
```

and replace:

```go
argsOptions := string(args[1])
```

with

```go
argsOptions := args[1:len(args)]
```

The variable `msg` is defined to read a string of argOptions, delete the stringification:

```go
msg := types.NewMsgCreatePoll(clientCtx.GetFromAddress().String(), string(argsTitle), argsOptions)
```

You end up with the following function:

```go
func CmdCreatePoll() *cobra.Command {
    cmd := &cobra.Command{
        Use:   "create-poll [title] [options]",
        Short: "Creates a new poll",
        Args:  cobra.MinimumNArgs(2),
        RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
            argsTitle := string(args[0])
            argsOptions := args[1:len(args)]

            clientCtx, err := client.GetClientTxContext(cmd)
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }

            msg := types.NewMsgCreatePoll(clientCtx.GetFromAddress().String(), string(argsTitle), argsOptions)
            if err := msg.ValidateBasic(); err != nil {
                return err
            }
            return tx.GenerateOrBroadcastTxCLI(clientCtx, cmd.Flags(), msg)
        },
    }

    flags.AddTxFlagsToCmd(cmd)

    return cmd
}
```

Now make similar changes for the function `CmdUpdatePoll`:

```go
Args:  cobra.MinimumNArgs(3),
```

and

```go
argsOptions := args[2:len(args)]
```

and

```go
msg := types.NewMsgUpdatePoll(clientCtx.GetFromAddress().String(), id, string(argsTitle), argsOptions)
```

These changes assume that all arguments after the first one represent a list of options.

You end up with the following function:

```go
func CmdUpdatePoll() *cobra.Command {
    cmd := &cobra.Command{
        Use:   "update-poll [id] [title] [options]",
        Short: "Update a poll",
        Args:  cobra.MinimumNArgs(3),
        RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
            id, err := strconv.ParseUint(args[0], 10, 64)
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }

            argsTitle := string(args[1])
            argsOptions := args[2:len(args)]

            clientCtx, err := client.GetClientTxContext(cmd)
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }

            msg := types.NewMsgUpdatePoll(clientCtx.GetFromAddress().String(), id, string(argsTitle), argsOptions)
            if err := msg.ValidateBasic(); err != nil {
                return err
            }
            return tx.GenerateOrBroadcastTxCLI(clientCtx, cmd.Flags(), msg)
        },
    }

    flags.AddTxFlagsToCmd(cmd)

    return cmd
}
```

For the app to recognize the changes that you have made, reset the application before you run it again. To reset the app:

```
starport serve --reset-once
```

## Add the Votes

At this point, you have created a blockchain where users can create polls. To enable the end users to cast votes on an existing poll, now it's time to create the code to make that happen.

A vote type transaction has the poll ID and an option. An option is the string representation of the selected answer.

```bash
starport type vote pollID option
```

Now, restart the application. Remember to use the `--reset-once` flag to recognize the code changes.

```bash
starport serve --reset-once
```

Remember, every time you reset the application state, all of the data from your previously created state is saved. When the app restarts, you receive new passphrases and new tokens. Make sure to update your wallet accounts in the frontend after you reset the state of the blockchain. {synopsis}

Now that you have made all the necessary changes to the app, take a look at the client-side application.

### Front-end application

Starport has generated a basic front-end for the app. For convenience [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) framework is used with [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for state management, but since all features of the app are exposed through an HTTP API, clients can be built using any language or framework.

You will be mostly interested in `vue/src/views` directory and the `vue/src/components` directory. These directories contain the code for the page templates of our app. `vue/src/store/` handles sending transactions and receiving data from our blockchain and [`@tendermint/vue`](https://github.com/tendermint/vue/) directory, which contains components, like buttons and forms. It contains the generated protobuffer file definitions that were defined in the `vue/src/store/generated/username/voter/username.voter.voter` directory.

Inside `vue/src/store/generated/username/voter/username.voter.voter/index.js` you can see the generated transactions `MsgCreatePoll`, `MsgUpdatePoll`, `MsgDeletePoll` which use [CosmJS](https://github.com/cosmwasm/cosmjs), a library for handling wallets, creating, signing and broadcasting transactions and define a Vuex store.

## Add your Module Component to the Frontend

Navigate to the views directory in `vue/src/views`

Since we don't need the default form component replace inside of `vue/src/views/Types.vue`

```javascript
<SpType modulePath="username.voter.voter" moduleType="Vote"  />
<SpType modulePath="username.voter.voter" moduleType="Poll"  />
```

with two new components and a title

```javascript
            <SpH3>
                Voter Module
            </SpH3>
            <poll-form />
            <poll-list />
```

In the `<script></script>` tags below, import the component like this

```javascript
import PollForm from "../components/PollForm";
import PollList from "../components/PollList";

export default {
    name: 'Types',
    components: { PollForm, PollList },
}
```

Start creating the components.

## Create the PollForm Component

For the PollForm, create a new file `PollForm.vue` in the `vue/src/components` directory.

The component has a title and two buttons.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div class="sp-voter__main sp-box sp-shadow sp-form-group">
        <form class="sp-voter__main__form">
          <div class="sp-voter__main__rcpt__header sp-box-header">
            Create a Poll
          </div>

          <input class="sp-input" placeholder="Title" v-model="title" />
          <div v-for="(option, index) in options" v-bind:key="'option' + index">
            <input class="sp-input" placeholder="Option" v-model="option.title" />
          </div>
          <sp-button @click="add">+ Add option</sp-button>
          <sp-button @click="submit">Create poll</sp-button>
        </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

In between `<script></script>` tags below the javacsript code. The Form manages the input of the user and broadcasts the transaction to the blockchain if the form gets submitted.

```javascript
export default {
  name: "PollForm",
  data() {
    return {
      title: "",
      options: [{
        title: "",
      }],
    };
  },
  computed: {

        currentAccount() {
            if (this._depsLoaded) {
                if (this.loggedIn) {
                    return this.$store.getters['common/wallet/address']
                } else {
                    return null
                }
            } else {
                return null
            }
        },
        loggedIn() {
            if (this._depsLoaded) {
                return this.$store.getters['common/wallet/loggedIn']
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
  },
  methods: {
    add() {
      this.options = [...this.options, { title: "" }];
    },
    async submit() {
      const value = {
        creator: this.currentAccount,
        title: this.title,
        options: this.options.map((o) => o.title),
      };
      await this.$store.dispatch("username.voter.voter/sendMsgCreatePoll", {
        value,
        fee: [],
      });
    },
  },
};
```

Refresh the page, sign in with a password and create a new poll. It takes a couple of seconds to process a transaction. Now, if you visit <http://localhost:1317/voter/poll> you should see a list of polls (this endpoint is defined in `x/voter/client/rest/queryPoll.go`):

```json
{
  "height": "0",
  "result": [
    {
      "creator": "cosmos19qqa7j73735w4pcx9mkkaxr00af7p432n62tv6",
      "id": "826477ab-0005-4e68-8031-19758d331681",
      "title": "A poll title",
      "options": ["First option", "The second option"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create the Poll List Component

Create a new component `PollList.vue` in `vue/src/components/PollList.vue`.

```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    <SpH3> List of Polls </SpH3>
    <div v-for="poll in polls" v-bind:key="'poll' + poll.id">
      <SpH3> {{poll.id}}. {{ poll.title }} </SpH3>
      <app-radio-item
        @click="submit(poll.id, option)"
        v-for="option in poll.options"
        v-bind:key="option"
        :value="option"
      />
      <app-text type="subtitle">Results: {{ results(poll.id) }}</app-text>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
<style>
.option-radio > .button {
  height: 40px;
  width: 50%;
}
</style>
```

in between `<script></script>` tags below this:

```javascript
import AppRadioItem from "./AppRadioItem";
import AppText from "./AppText";
import { countBy } from "lodash";

export default {
  components: { AppText, AppRadioItem },
  data() {
    return {
      selected: "",
    };
  },
  computed: {

        currentAccount() {
            if (this._depsLoaded) {
                if (this.loggedIn) {
                    return this.$store.getters['common/wallet/address']
                } else {
                    return null
                }
            } else {
                return null
            }
        },
        loggedIn() {
            if (this._depsLoaded) {
                return this.$store.getters['common/wallet/loggedIn']
            } else {
                return false
            }
        },
    polls() {
      return (
        this.$store.getters["username.voter.voter/getPollAll"]({
          params: {}
        })?.Poll ?? []
      );
    },
    votes() {
      return (
        this.$store.getters["username.voter.voter/getVoteAll"]({
          params: {}
        })?.Vote ?? []
      );
    },
  },
  methods: {
    results(id) {
      const results = this.votes.filter((v) => v.pollID === id);
      return countBy(results, "option");
    },
    async submit(pollID, option) {

      const value = { creator: this.currentAccount, pollID, option };
      await this.$store.dispatch("username.voter.voter/sendMsgCreateVote", {
        value,
        fee: [],
      });
      await this.$store.dispatch("username.voter.voter/QueryPollAll", {
        options: { subscribe: true, all: true },
        params: {},
      });
    },
  },
};
```

The `PollList` component lists every poll, including the options for that poll as buttons. Selecting an option triggers a `submit` method that broadcasts a transaction with a "create vote" message and fetches data back from our application.

Two components are still missing from our App, to make it a bit better looking. Let's add `AppRadioItem.vue` and `AppText.vue`.

### Add the Options Component

`vue/src/components/AppRadioItem.vue`

```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    <button class="button">{{ value }}</button>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.button {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  padding: 0.75rem 1rem;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 6px;
  user-select: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.1s;
  font-weight: 500;
  outline: none;
  border: none;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.01);
  width: 100%;
  font-family: inherit;
  text-align: left;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: inherit;
}
.button:hover {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
    0 1px 5px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
.button:focus {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
    0 1px 5px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
.button:active {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07);
  color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  transform: scale(0.998);
}
</style>
```

In the `<script></script>` tag below this:

```javascript
export default {
  props: {
    value: "",
  },
};
```

### Add the Poll List Text Component

`vue/src/components/AppText.vue`

```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    <div :class="[`${type}`]">
      <slot />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
  font-weight: 800;
  letter-spacing: 0.03em;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
}
.h2 {
  font-weight: 800;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.05em;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  margin-top: 2rem;
}
.subtitle {
  color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  font-size: 0.85rem;
}
</style>
```

In between `<script></script>` tags below this

```javascript
export default {
  props: {
    type: {
      default: "p1",
    },
  },
};
```

Now in the `App.vue` you need to update the JavaScript to fetch the votes.

### Update the Frontend App

The App file handles the transactions of the components. Modify the script in `vue/src/App.vue` to look the following

```javascript
import './scss/app.scss'
import '@starport/vue/lib/starport-vue.css'
import Sidebar from './components/Sidebar'

export default {
    components: {
        Sidebar
    },
    data() {
        return {
            initialized: false
        }
    },
    computed: {
        hasWallet() {
            return this.$store.hasModule([ 'common', 'wallet'])
        }
    },
    async created() {
        await this.$store.dispatch('common/env/init')
        this.initialized = true
        await this.$store.dispatch("username.voter.voter/QueryPollAll",{options:{subscribe:true, all:true},params:{}})
        await this.$store.dispatch("username.voter.voter/QueryVoteAll",{options:{subscribe:true, all:true},params:{}})
    },
    errorCaptured(err) {
        console.log(err)
        return false
    }
}
```

By now should be able to see the same UI as in the first screenshot. Try creating polls and casting votes. You may notice that it's possible to cast multiple votes for one poll. This is not what we want, so let's fix this behaviour.

## Access the API

To fix this issue you first have to understand how data is stored in our application.

Think of the data storage as a lexicographically ordered key value store. You can loop through the entries, filter by key prefix, add, update and delete entries. It is easier to visualize the store as JSON.

When you create a poll and cast on vote, this is the resulting JSON.

See the API and JSON output of your created Poll endpoint at <http://localhost:1317/username/voter/voter/poll>

```json
{
  "Poll": [
    {
      "creator": "cosmos1vedd97ku2n8qtsccrfna5gg0repdnk0a9cl7ze",
      "id": "0",
      "title": "Soft drinks",
      "options": ["Coca-Cola", "Pepsi"]
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_key": null,
    "total": "1"
  }
}
```

For the votes you can go to the API page on <http://localhost:1317/username/voter/voter/vote>

```json

{
  "Vote": [
    {
      "creator": "cosmos1vedd97ku2n8qtsccrfna5gg0repdnk0a9cl7ze",
      "id": "0",
      "pollID": "0",
      "option": "Pepsi"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_key": null,
    "total": "2"
  }
}
```

The endpoint paths are defined by the username you use when bootstrapping the application with Starport, together with your module name.

Looking into this data, you can see the combination of `creator` and `pollID` is what we are looking for. Each account should only be allowed to have 1 vote per pollID.

## Limit to One Vote per User

The logic for access to a certain transaction should be in the `keeper` directory. For the votes transaction logic, open the `msg_server_vote.go` file at `x/voter/keeper/msg_server_vote.go` and modify the `CreateVote` function.

```go
func (k msgServer) CreateVote(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgCreateVote) (*types.MsgCreateVoteResponse, error) {
    ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

      // Get all existing votes
    voteList := k.GetAllVote(ctx)
    for _, existingVote := range voteList {
        // Check if the account has already voted on this PollID
        if existingVote.Creator == msg.Creator && existingVote.PollID == msg.PollID {
              // Return an error when a vote has been casted by this account on this PollID
            return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrUnauthorized, "Vote already casted.")
        }
    }

    id := k.AppendVote(
        ctx,
        msg.Creator,
        msg.PollID,
        msg.Option,
    )

    return &types.MsgCreateVoteResponse{
        Id: id,
    }, nil
}
```

Now when you restart the app, in the frontend you should be able to only cast 1 vote per poll.

## Introducing a fee for creating polls

Add the logic for the transaction, that creating a poll costs 200 tokens.

We already require users to have accounts registered, and each user has tokens on balance. The only thing you need to do is to send coins from user's account to a module account before we create a poll.

## Add the Bank Keeper to the Module

First, load the `expected_keepers` in the `x/voter/types/expected_keepers.go` file. This will define all the bank functions available in your module.

```go
package types

import sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"

// BankKeeper defines the expected bank keeper
type BankKeeper interface {
    SendCoins(ctx sdk.Context, fromAddr sdk.AccAddress, toAddr sdk.AccAddress, amt sdk.Coins) error
    MintCoins(ctx sdk.Context, moduleName string, amt sdk.Coins) error
    BurnCoins(ctx sdk.Context, moduleName string, amt sdk.Coins) error
    SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount(ctx sdk.Context, senderModule string, recipientAddr sdk.AccAddress, amt sdk.Coins) error
    SendCoinsFromAccountToModule(ctx sdk.Context, senderAddr sdk.AccAddress, recipientModule string, amt sdk.Coins) error
}
```

Second, add the keeper to the `x/voter/keeper/keeper.go` file. Add it to the `type` as well as the `NewKeeper` function as follows:

```go
type (
    Keeper struct {
        cdc        codec.Marshaler
        storeKey   sdk.StoreKey
        memKey     sdk.StoreKey
        bankKeeper types.BankKeeper
    }
)

func NewKeeper(cdc codec.Marshaler, storeKey, memKey sdk.StoreKey, bankKeeper types.BankKeeper) *Keeper {
    return &Keeper{
        cdc:        cdc,
        storeKey:   storeKey,
        memKey:     memKey,
        bankKeeper: bankKeeper,
    }
}
```

Finally, add the bank module to the `app.go` file in `x/app/app.go`

```go
app.voterKeeper = *voterkeeper.NewKeeper(
  appCodec, keys[votertypes.StoreKey], keys[votertypes.MemStoreKey], app.BankKeeper,
)
```

Now you are ready to use all the bank functions that you added to the expected keepers file above. Next you will define how the transaction will require the funds in order to exectue the transaction.

## Modify the Message with the price

Modify the msg at `x/voter/keeper/msg_server_poll.go`.

```go
package keeper

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    sdkerrors "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/errors"
    "github.com/tendermint/tendermint/crypto"
    "github.com/username/voter/x/voter/types"
)

func (k msgServer) CreatePoll(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgCreatePoll) (*types.MsgCreatePollResponse, error) {
    ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

    moduleAcct := sdk.AccAddress(crypto.AddressHash([]byte(types.ModuleName)))
    feeCoins, err := sdk.ParseCoinsNormalized("200token")
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    creatorAddress, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(msg.Creator)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    if err := k.bankKeeper.SendCoins(ctx, creatorAddress, moduleAcct, feeCoins); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    id := k.AppendPoll(
        ctx,
        msg.Creator,
        msg.Title,
        msg.Options,
    )

    return &types.MsgCreatePollResponse{
        Id: id,
    }, nil
}
```

The fee payment happens before `k.AppendPoll`. This way, if a user does not have enough tokens, the application will raise an error and will not proceed to creating a poll. Make sure to have `"github.com/tendermint/tendermint/crypto"` added to the import statement (if your text editor didn't do that for you).

Now, restart the app and try creating several polls to see how this affects your token balance.

Congratulations, you have built a blockchain voting application.
