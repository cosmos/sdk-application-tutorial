# User interface

After you navigate to the UI, the following `vue` UI is available at `localhost:8080`: 

![](./userinterface.png)

After using the mnemonic from the output of `starport chain serve`, you can use this UI to perform `create` and `list` operations for your blog application's `post` and `comment` types.

### Inspect the Frontend

Open the file at `vue/src/views/Types.vue`.

To see a form for creating `post` items in your app add a `<SpType ... />` component:

```vue
	<div class="sp-container">
		<!-- this line is used by starport scaffolding # 4 -->
		<SpType modulePath="example.blog.blog" moduleType="Post" />
		<SpType modulePath="example.blog.blog" moduleType="Comment" />
	</div>
```
