# Updating the UI

At this point, we have a functioning blockchain. Now, we can add a UI to upload file hashes from our browser.

First, start by navigating to `localhost:8080`, which hosts our vue applicaton.

## Creating a new Component

In order to make it easier for users to upload a hash to the blockchain, we will create a new component for uploading a proof.

We can create a new folder and file called `vue/src/components/UploadProof.vue`, and add our new component into our `vue/src/views/Index.vue` file:

#### `UploadProof.vue`
```vue
<template>
    <div></div>
</template>
<script>export default {}</script>
<style></style>
```

#### `Index.vue`
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div class="sp-container">
      <sp-sign-in />
      <sp-bank-balances />
      <sp-token-send />
      <upload-proof />
      <!-- this line is used by starport scaffolding # 4 -->
      <sp-type-form type="claim" :fields="['proof']" />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import * as sp from "@tendermint/vue";
import UploadProof from "@/components/UploadProof";

export default {
  components: { ...sp, UploadProof },
};
</script>
```

Now, we should see our UI update whenever we add something to our component.


## Hashing functionality

First, we will add hashing functionality to our blockchain, which will require the `js-sha256` package. Let's install it via `npm`, and make sure we're in the `vue/` directory.

```sh
npm install --save js-sha256
```

Next, we'll add some elements to create the layout for our component.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <sp-h3>Calculate Proof</sp-h3>
    <input type="file" @change="hash" id="file" />
    {{ hashed }}
    <sp-button
      @click="submit"
      :loading="flight"
      :disabled="hashed == '' || flight"
      >Submit Proof as a new Claim</sp-button
    >
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { SpH3, SpButton } from "@tendermint/vue";

export default {
  components: {
    SpH3,
    SpButton,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      hashed: "",
      flight: false,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    hash(e) {},
    async submit() {},
  }
}
</script>
```

## Implementing our hash functionality

As mentioned earlier, we want to be able to upload a file to the browser, calculate its hash, and submitting our hash to the blockchain.

Let's start by adding functionality for creating the hash:

```js
import { sha256 } from "js-sha256";

...
  methods: {
    hash(e) {
      const files = e.target.files
      if (!files.length) return;
      // Read the file and hash it
      const reader = new FileReader();
      reader.onload = (ev) => {
        this.hashed = sha256(ev.target.result);
      };
      reader.readAsArrayBuffer(files[0]);
    },
```

And now we can add our `submit` function, which will dispatch actions to the `cosmos` store for submitting and fetching things from our blockchain.

```js
    async submit() {
      // Submit
      this.flight = true;
      await this.$store.dispatch("cosmos/entitySubmit", {
        type: "claim",
        body: {
          proof: this.hashed,
        },
      });
      await this.$store.dispatch("cosmos/entityFetch", {
        type: "claim",
      });

      // Clear fields
      this.flight = false;
      this.hashed = "";
      document.getElementById("file").value = "";
    },
```

Finally, we can add some css to match the style of the app:

```vue
<style scoped>
div {
  font-family: "Inter", "Helvetica", sans-serif;
}

input {
  font-size: inherit;
  margin-top: 2rem;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
}
</style>
```

Now, we can log in using the mnemonic provided by running the `starport serve` command, and start uploading out PoFE claims to the blockchain!

Congratulations, your UI is complete!
