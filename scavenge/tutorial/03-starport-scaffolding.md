# Starport
## Requirements 

For this tutorial we will be using [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport) v0.0.10, an easy to use tool for building blockchains. To install `starport` into `/usr/local/bin`, run the following command:

```
curl https://i.jpillora.com/tendermint/starport@v0.0.10! | bash
```

You can also use Starport v0.0.10 on the web in a [browser-based IDE](http://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tendermint/starport/tree/v0.0.10). Learn more about other ways to [install Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport/blob/develop/docs/1%20Introduction/2%20Install.md).

## Creating a blockchain

Afterwards, you can enter in `starport` in your terminal, and should see the following help text displayed:
```sh
$ starport
A tool for scaffolding out Cosmos applications

Usage:
  starport [command]

Available Commands:
  add         Adds a feature to a project.
  app         Generates an empty application
  help        Help about any command
  serve       Launches a reloading server
  type        Generates CRUD actions for type
  version     Version will output the current build information

Flags:
  -h, --help     help for starport
  -t, --toggle   Help message for toggle

Use "starport [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Now that the `starport` command is available, you can scaffold an application by using the `starport app` command:

```bash
$ starport app --help
Generates an empty application

Usage:
  starport app [github.com/org/repo] [flags]

Flags:
      --address-prefix string   Address prefix (default "cosmos")
  -h, --help                    help for app
      --sdk-version string      Target Cosmos-SDK Version -launchpad -stargate (default "stargate")
```

Let's start by scaffolding our `scavenge` application with `starport app`. This should generate a directory of folders called `scavenge` inside your current working directory, as well as scaffold our `scavenge` module. 

```bash
$ starport app github.com/github-username/scavenge --sdk-version="launchpad"

‚≠êÔ∏è Successfully created a Cosmos app 'scavenge'.
üëâ Get started with the following commands:

 % cd scavenge
 % starport serve

NOTE: add --verbose flag for verbose (detailed) output.
```

You've successfully scaffolded a Cosmos SDK application using `starport`! In the next step, we're going to run the application using the instructions provided.
