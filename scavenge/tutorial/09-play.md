Let's follow the instructions and create a new scavenge. The first parameter we need is the `solution`, but probably we should also know what the actual quesiton is that our solution solves (our `description`). How about our challenge question be something family friendly like: `What's brown and sticky?`. Of course the only solution to this question is: `A stick`.

Next we should specify our `reward`. Let's give away `100token` as a reward for solving our scavenge.

Now we have all the pieces needed to create our message. Let's piece them all together, adding the flag `--from` so the CLI knows who is sending it:

```
scavenged tx scavenge createScavenge "A stick" "What's brown and sticky?" 100token --from alice
```

Let's follow the instructions and submit the answer as a commit on behalf of `bob`:

```
scavenged tx scavenge commitSolution "A stick" --from bob
```

We don't need to put the `solutionHash` because it can be generated by hashing our actual solution.

Since all we need is the solution again let's send and confirm our final message:

```
scavenged tx scavenge revealSolution "A stick" --from bob
```
