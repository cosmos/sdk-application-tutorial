## Prerequisites

After a quick [Development Environment Setup](SETUP.md), you're ready to select a tutorial from the list below.

## [Nameservice](./nameservice/tutorial/00-intro.md)

The real deal, full-length tutorial in which you will build a fully functional naming service on a blockchain. This tutorial does not use the `starter` package, rather you will be configuring and composing a full application yourself.
The nameservice tutorial also has translations and a slide deck.

## [Scavenge](./scavenge/tutorial/01-background.md)

A scavenger hunt of sorts! Users post questions with hashed answers and bounties for whoever can solve them using a commit-reveal scheme that prevents front-running.
