## [Hellochain](./hellochain/tutorial/00-intro.md)

This is the quick and simple "Hello World" introduction to building with the Cosmos SDK. You will build a fully-funcitonal blockchain with payment functionality and a custom "greeter" module. This tutorial makes use of the `utils/starter` package to reduce boilerplate and allow you to focus on the core concepts. Start here if you are evaluating Cosmos as your possible platform of choice.

## [Nameservice](./nameservice/tutorial/00-intro.md)

The real deal, full-length tutorial in which you will build a fully functional naming service on a blockchain. This tutorial does not use the `starter` package, rather you will be configuring and composing a full application yourself.
The nameservice tutorial also has translations and a slide deck.
